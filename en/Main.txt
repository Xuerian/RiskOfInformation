		"MORE_MUSIC_DESC" : "        <color=#D47FFF>'Proc Chance'</color> is the chance that any given instance of damage will induce an additional effect. <color=#FF7F7F>Not every item or attack has a Proc Chance!</color> For example, if you have <style=cIsDamage>3 Sticky Bombs</style>, at <color=#D47FFF>5% Proc Chance</color> each, your total <color=#FF7F7F>base chance</color> to <color=#D47FFF>Proc</color> a <style=cIsDamage>Sticky Bomb</style> is <color=#D47FFF>15%</color>, because you have <style=cIsDamage>3</style> of them. Of course, <color=#FF7F7F>it's not always that simple.</color>\r\n        An attack's <color=#D47FFF>'Proc Coefficient'</color> is a <style=cIsUtility>multiplicative modifier</style> between <color=#D47FFF>0</color> and <color=#D47FFF>1</color> that further determines the chance of <color=#FF7F7F>actually</color> triggering a Proc. For example, the <style=cIsHealing>Commando's 'Double Tap'</style> has a <color=#D47FFF>Proc Coefficient of 1</color>. If the <style=cIsHealing>Commando</style> has <style=cIsDamage>3 Sticky Bombs</style>, and shoots <color=#FF7F7F>one</color> bullet at an enemy, that bullet has a <color=#D47FFF>(15%x1)</color> <color=#FF7F7F>effective</color> <color=#D47FFF>Proc Chance</color> - in this case, it's still <color=#D47FFF>15%</color>, because the <color=#D47FFF>Proc Coefficient</color> of <style=cIsHealing>'Double Tap'</style> is <color=#D47FFF>1</color>. <style=cIsUtility>However!</style> <style=cIsHealing>MUL-T's 'Auto-Nailgun'</style> has a <color=#D47FFF>Proc Coefficient of 0.4!</color> If <style=cIsHealing>MUL-T</style> has <style=cIsDamage>3 Sticky Bombs</style>, and shoots <color=#FF7F7F>one</color> bullet at an enemy, that bullet has a <color=#D47FFF>(15%x0.4)</color> <color=#FF7F7F>effective</color> <color=#D47FFF>Proc Chance</color> - in <style=cIsHealing>MUL-T's</style> case, it's <color=#FF7F7F>actually only</color> <color=#D47FFF>6%</color>, because <style=cIsUtility>15% times 0.4 is 6%</style>! Despite having the <style=cIsDamage>same items</style>, <style=cIsHealing>MUL-T</style> and the <style=cIsHealing>Commando</style> have <color=#FF7F7F>much different chances</color> of initiating <color=#D47FFF>Procs!</color>\r\n        Anything that has a <color=#D47FFF>Proc Coefficient</color> will be documented in <color=#D47FFF>purple</color>, for your reference and convenience. If that all seems complicated, <style=cIsUtility>don't worry!</style> The game does all of this math automatically, and very quickly. You don't need to stress out about who might be 'better off' with different <color=#D47FFF>Proccing items</color> and <color=#D47FFF>Proc Chances</color>, though. We're all here to have fun! Just make sure to <style=cIsHealing>give the Engie his Fungus!</style>\r\n        This modpack includes a mod called <style=cIsUtility>'ItemStatsMod'!</style> When you hold <style=cIsUtility>TAB</style> to view everyone's items in-game, <style=cIsDamage>try mousing over some items!</style> The mod <style=cIsUtility>calculates item stacks</style> and <style=cIsUtility>lists a stack's total sums</style> at the bottom of the <style=cIsDamage>respective tooltip!</style> No more doing math in your head, or looking up formulas on the wiki - it's all baked into the mod itself. Just make sure to keep <color=#D47FFF>Proc Coefficients</color> in mind for different attacks!",
